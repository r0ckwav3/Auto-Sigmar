# Auto-Sigmar
This program automatically plays the Opus Magnum minigame Sigmar's Garden.

## Current state
Waits 5 seconds and then takes a screenshot, saving it at `test.png`.

## Notes
This program was made with my monitor size in mind, and as such assumes you are playing in 1440x900 resolution on a 1440x900 display.
